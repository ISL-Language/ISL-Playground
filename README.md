# ISL Playground
A tool for programming in [ISL](https://github.com/LightningLaser8/ISL), and making learning it easier. With syntax highlighting, error reporting and extension importing (from anywhere that allows it), this should give users a way to easily create ISL programs, including the ability to save and load ISL from your computer.
